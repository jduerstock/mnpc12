Microcom MNP Library
(Microsoft C Version)


This diskette contains code and documentation for an IBM 
PC/compatible implementation of Class 2 of the MNP link 
protocol.  This is suitable for use with a Microsoft C
application using the small code/small data model.
See the programmer's manual, in file 'mnpc.doc', for
further details.

These files are in the public domain and may be copied, 
distributed, etc.  Note, however, that these materials are 
made available by Microcom, Inc., on an 'as is' basis and, 
while it is believed that the code here is a correct 
implementation,  Microcom does not warrant them to be error-
free or suitable for any particular purpose.

The files are as follows:

	mnpc.doc - programmer's guide to the MNP library

	bldc.bat - batch file which builds the MNP object
                library, 'mnp.lib', from the source files
                on this diskette (Note: Microsoft C         
                compiler, Macro Assembler and librarian
                are required)

	mnp.lib - MNP object library

	*.c/*.asm - MNP source files

	testc.c - a sample program - a simple terminal 
			emulator
